# nemo-test
Here I have various testing scripts that I made to test Riva.

Additionally, you can find a script eval_testset_offline.py to run evaluation on TESTSET files with all available Nemo models. 
In contrast to riva scripts, the eval_testset_offline.py requires NeMo environment to be setup on a machine with NVIDIA GPU to run.
To use the scrip, run NeMo container on nemo VM and run as specified in the header.
